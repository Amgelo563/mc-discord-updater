# üìä MC > Discord Updater

---

## üöÄ Introduction

A Discord bot script that updates a channel or Discord activity to fit the amount of players on a MC server.
At the moment, it supports channel name updating, channel description updating and bot presence updating.

---

## üöß Warning

Discord's API limits on channel renaming and topic updating may be high at the moment (nobody seems to know which they exactly are, but
around 2 renames per 10 minutes seems to be a safe guess). At such, don't try setting timeouts to values that are too low or it may
not work at all.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Setting the Bot up

This bot uses Discord.js v13, so **Node.js 16.6.0 or newer** is required.

1. Change `exampleconfig.json` according to your needs.
2. Rename `exampleconfig.json` to `config.json`.
3. On a command prompt opened on the bot's working folder, use `npm i` to install the dependencies.
4. On the same command prompt use `node .`
5. Enjoy!

## üíª Development

The bot uses the [minecraft-server-ping](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minecraft-server-ping) to get server data directly from the server by pinging it. If you think you have a better implementation, feel free to leave a PR.
