# 📊 MC > Discord Updater

---

## 🚀 Introduction

A Discord bot script that updates a channel's name to fit the amount of players on a MC server.
At the moment, it supports channel name updating, channel description updating and bot presence updating.

---

## 🚧 Warning

Discord's API limits on channel renaming and topic updating may be high at the moment (nobody seems to know which they exactly are, but
around 2 renames per 10 minutes seems to be a safe guess). At such, don't try setting timeouts to values that are too low or it may
not work at all.

## 💻 Development

The bot uses the [Minetools API](https://api.minetools.eu/) to get server data, but it could technically be adapted to any kind of online API or direct connection to the server. If you have a better example, feel free to let me know or leave a PR.
